[Tim Smith](http://twitter.com/ttimsmith) asked me to guest host for The East Wing while he was out of town.

I took the opportunity to chat with [Sean Martell](http://twitter.com/mart3ll), Art Director at Mozilla, about how he designs in the open, mentors new designers, and how he works with the Mozilla community.

You can listen to the episode on [Goodstuff.fm](http://goodstuff.fm/theeastwing/9).
