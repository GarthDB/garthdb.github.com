[Tim Smith](http://twitter.com/ttimsmith) invited me to join him on the 3rd Episode of The East Wing.

We had a good time talking about my failures as a freelancer, my trouble with agency work, and my love of open source.

It is always good to talk to Tim.

You can listen to the episode on [Goodstuff.fm](http://goodstuff.fm/theeastwing/3).
